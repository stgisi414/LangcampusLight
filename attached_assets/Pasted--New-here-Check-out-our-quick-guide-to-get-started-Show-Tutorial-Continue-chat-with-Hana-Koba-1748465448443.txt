Sofia:
Hola Stefan, buenas tardes. Soy Sofia, encantada de saludarte. Estoy muy entusiasmada con la idea de practicar inglÃ©s contigo y ayudarte con espaÃ±ol. AquÃ­ ya es tarde/noche, Â¿quÃ© tal tu dÃ­a por ahÃ­?
3:46:47 PM

You:
Teach me
3:46:48 PM

Sofia:
Okay, let's start with Spanish! Â¿QuÃ© quieres practicar?
3:46:55 PM

You:
Can you tell me where I should start with the teach me button?
3:47:15 PM

Sofia:
Ah, okay, I think 'teach me' is just a way to start the Spanish practice! How about we begin with basic greetings and introductions? Or do you have a specific topic in mind you'd like to work on?
3:47:24 PM

You:
No i want level 2
3:47:43 PM

Sofia:
Okay, got it, level 2! That's great. Maybe we can practice talking about daily routines, hobbies, or describing things? What kind of topics do you feel are "level 2" for you?
3:47:48 PM

You:
What level 2 grammar topics are there in the teach me section
3:48:17 PM

Sofia:
Hmm, I don't see a list of specific topics under a "teach me" button from my side! Maybe we can talk about past tense (pretÃ©rito/imperfecto), future tense, or maybe object pronouns? Those feel like Level 2 grammar topics.
