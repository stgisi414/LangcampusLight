Can you explain how the action button appears when text is selected

The action button appears when text is selected due to the selectionchange event listener in your script.js. Here's how it works step-by-step:

Text Selection Detection: When a user selects text on the page, the selectionchange event is triggered. This event is captured by the listener set up in the script.js.

Retrieving Selected Text: The listener retrieves the currently selected text using window.getSelection() and checks if there is any selected text.

Popup Creation: If there's selected text and the selection is part of the chat messages (inside the messagesContainer), a popup is created:

A <div> is created and styled as a selection popup.
The popup contains a button that calls the useSelectedText(selectedText) function when clicked.
Positioning the Popup: The position of the popup is set right below the selected text based on the bounding rectangle of the selection.

Displaying the Popup: Finally, the popup is added to the document body, so it becomes visible to the user.

Here's the relevant code from the script.js that handles the action button on text selection:

let selectionPopup = null;
document.addEventListener('selectionchange', () => {
  const selection = window.getSelection();
  const selectedText = selection.toString().trim();
  if (selectionPopup) {
    selectionPopup.remove();
    selectionPopup = null;
  }
  if (selectedText && messagesContainer.contains(selection.anchorNode) && selection.anchorNode.parentElement.closest('.message')) {
    const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);
    const rect = range.getBoundingClientRect();
    selectionPopup = document.createElement('div');
    selectionPopup.className = 'selection-popup';
    selectionPopup.innerHTML = `<button onclick="useSelectedText('${selectedText.replace(/'/g, "\\'")}')" class="icon-button" title="Use Text"><i class="fas fa-paste"></i></button>`;
    selectionPopup.style.top = `${rect.bottom + window.scrollY + 5}px`;
    selectionPopup.style.left = `${rect.left + window.scrollX + (rect.width / 2) - 20}px`;
    document.body.appendChild(selectionPopup);
  }
});
When the user highlights text in the chat messages, this code creates a popup with a button to use that selected text seamlessly within the chat application.
