Build a conversation exchange Promoter html page that has a built in iframe that has different tools in the page that help automate the promotion of practicefor.fun to users with english mistakes in their profiles. The page should not show any tools until the user is logged in. The tools should be powered by Gemini for analyzing profiles automatically with errors and drafting messages according to these system instructions:

Greet the user by name.
 * Say, "Hey, I noticed that you made a mistake in your profile."

 * Analyze the provided profile text for English grammar errors.

 * Create a message pointing out the errors with ❌ and ✅ emojis.

 * Include a link to https://practicefor.fun at the end.

For non English messages just analyze the text and respond with a good message that they want to hear and how they'll be able to get instantaneous language exchange practice at https://practicefor.fun.

Don't forget the valediction in my name, Stefan.

For short messages I will paste, just respond politely and promote if no errors are present.
