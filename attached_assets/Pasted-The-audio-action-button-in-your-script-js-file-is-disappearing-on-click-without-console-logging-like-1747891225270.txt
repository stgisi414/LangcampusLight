The audio action button in your script.js file is disappearing on click without console logging likely due to an unhandled error or an issue in the event handling logic, particularly within the playAudioFromText function or the way the button's state is managed during the click event.

Here's a breakdown of potential issues and how to address them:

Potential Causes and Solutions
Unhandled Promise Rejection or Error in playAudioFromText:

Issue: If an error occurs inside playAudioFromText (e.g., API call failure, audio decoding error) and is not caught, or if a promise is rejected without a .catch() handler, it could halt script execution or lead to unexpected behavior, like the button being removed by a finally block or an earlier error handler without proper logging.
Code in script.js: The playAudioFromText function has a try...catch block, but an error within the asynchronous operations (like Workspace or audio.play()) might not be caught correctly if not handled within their respective promise chains.
JavaScript

// Snippet from playAudioFromText in script.js
try {
    // ...
    const response = await fetch(TTS_API_URL, { /* ... */ });
    // ...
    const audioBlob = await response.blob();
    // ...
    const playPromise = audio.play();
    if (playPromise !== undefined) {
        await playPromise; // Potential unhandled rejection here
        button.innerHTML = 'ðŸ”Š Playing...';
        button.style.display = 'flex';
    }
// ...
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Audio playback failed:', error); // This might not catch all async errors
    // ...
}
Solution: Ensure all promises have .catch() handlers. For example, add a .catch() to the audio.play() promise. Add more specific console.log statements at the beginning and end of the click handler and critical points within playAudioFromText to trace execution flow.
Premature Button Removal or State Reset:

Issue: The button's innerHTML is changed to "Loading..." and then "Played" or "Error". If an error occurs before "Playing..." is set, and the subsequent setTimeout(() => button.remove(), 2000); in the onended or onerror (or even the main catch block of playAudioFromText) is reached, the button might be removed before you see the error state or any logs from the click action itself. The isPlaying flag might also not be reset correctly, preventing future clicks if the button wasn't removed.
Code in script.js:
JavaScript

// Snippet from playAudioFromText
audio.onended = () => {
    button.innerHTML = 'âœ… Played';
    // ...
    setTimeout(() => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(audioUrl);
        button.remove(); // Button removed
    }, 2000);
};
// Similar removal in audio.onerror and the main catch block.

// Snippet from the button's click listener
button.addEventListener('click', async (e) => {
    // ...
    try {
        // ...
        await playAudioFromText(text, button); // If this errors quickly...
        // ...
        setTimeout(() => button.remove(), 2000); // Or this one from playAudioFromText gets called
    } catch (error) {
        // ...
        // The button might be removed by playAudioFromText's internal error handling.
    } finally {
        isPlaying = false; // This runs even if an error occurred
    }
});
Solution:
Delay Removal on Error: In the catch block of playAudioFromText and the button's click listener, ensure the error message is displayed for a sufficient time before removing the button.
Consolidate Removal Logic: Consider centralizing the button removal logic to avoid race conditions. The finally block in the click listener could be responsible for deciding if/when to remove the button based on success/error flags set by playAudioFromText.
console.log Buffering or Overwriting:

Issue: While less likely for disappearing logs, sometimes browser console logs can be buffered or cleared by rapid subsequent updates or page changes (though not evident here). More plausibly, if the "console logging" you're referring to is within the button's innerHTML (like "Loading...", "Playing..."), it's being overwritten very quickly.
Solution: Use console.log in the browser's developer tools, not just innerHTML changes, for debugging. Place console.log('Button clicked'); as the very first line in your click event listener.
Event Propagation Issues (e.preventDefault(), e.stopPropagation()):

Issue: You have e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation() in the button's click listener. While usually fine, ensure they are not unintentionally preventing a parent element's handler that might be necessary for some part of the UI to function or log correctly (though this is unlikely to cause the button itself to disappear silently without an error).
Code in script.js:
JavaScript

button.addEventListener('click', async (e) => {
    console.log('========= AUDIO BUTTON CLICK START ========='); // This should be the first log
    // ...
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    // ...
});
Solution: This is likely not the primary cause but good to be aware of. The console.log you added at the start is excellent. If it doesn't appear, the issue is likely that the event listener itself is not firing as expected, or an error occurs before this line.
CSS or Parent Element Interference:

Issue: Although the button is appended to document.body and has position: fixed, it's possible some other JavaScript or CSS on the page is inadvertently hiding or removing elements with the .audio-button class or affecting its visibility. The document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'; could also have unintended side effects on fixed elements if not managed carefully.
Solution: Inspect the button in the browser's developer tools immediately after clicking (if possible, by adding a debugger; statement or pausing script execution). Check its display, visibility, and opacity properties. Look for any parent elements that might be getting hidden.
isPlaying Flag Logic:

Issue: The isPlaying flag is intended to prevent multiple simultaneous playbacks. If an error occurs and isPlaying is not reset to false in all error paths, subsequent clicks might do nothing because the if (isPlaying) check at the start of the click handler exits early.

Code in script.js:

JavaScript

let isPlaying = false;
button.addEventListener('click', async (e) => {
    // ...
    if (isPlaying) {
        console.error('Already playing state detected - preventing duplicate playback'); // This log *would* show
        return;
    }
    isPlaying = true; // Set true
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (error) {
        // ...
    } finally {
        isPlaying = false; // Reset here
    }
});
The finally block correctly resets isPlaying. However, if playAudioFromText has its own isPlaying logic or removes the button, this might not be sufficient.

Solution: Ensure isPlaying is managed consistently. The current finally block is good.

HTTPS Requirement and initAudioContext:

Issue: The playAudioFromText function correctly checks for HTTPS and initializes AudioContext. If initAudioContext() fails silently or window.location.protocol !== 'https:' is true and the error is not clearly communicated before the button disappears, this could be a cause.
Solution: Add explicit logging if these conditions fail before the button is manipulated.
Recommended Debugging Steps:
Aggressive Logging:

Place console.log('Audio button click initiated'); as the very first line in the button.addEventListener('click', async (e) => { ... }); callback.
Add console.log('Entering playAudioFromText'); at the start of playAudioFromText.
Add console.log('TTS API call starting'); before the Workspace call to TTS_API_URL.
Add console.log('TTS API response received:', response.status); after the Workspace.
Add console.log('Audio blob received, size:', audioBlob.size); after getting the blob.
Add console.log('Attempting audio.play()'); before audio.play().
Test playAudioFromText Independently: If possible, try calling playAudioFromText with a static text and a dummy button object from the console to isolate its behavior.

Simplify Error Handling Temporarily: To see if complex error handling is hiding the issue, temporarily simplify the catch blocks in both the click listener and playAudioFromText to just console.error('Error occurred:', error); without modifying the button, to ensure errors are seen.

Check createAudioButton Positioning and Visibility:

The code button.style.pointerEvents = 'auto'; is correctly set.
The button is appended to document.body.
The z-index is high (10000).
By adding more detailed logging at each step of the button's click lifecycle and within the playAudioFromText function, you should be able to pinpoint where the execution stops or goes awry, leading to the button disappearing and the lack of expected console messages. The issue is most likely an unhandled error in an async operation within playAudioFromText that causes the error handling in that function to remove the button before your click listener's logs can show.
